The true number of SMTA issued (signed) could be higher, as some SMTAs signed may not be reported through the online system. SMTA is a private contract, therefore it is reported by users, not by a government focal point. Users also have a two-year period for reporting their SMTAs. Thus the number reported for a specific year may change during the following two years. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"The position of the United Kingdom for all sub-indicators is given below. \n  \n1.
