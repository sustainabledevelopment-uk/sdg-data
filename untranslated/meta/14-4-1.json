It is based on a group of 20 species in 57 stocks for which there are reliable estimates of fishing mortality and spawning biomass, together with MSY reference points for fishing mortality and biomass that allow the sustainability of the stocks to be evaluated. The indicator stocks include a range of local and widely distributed species of major importance to the UK fishing industry. The measures are assessed as follows \u2013 A) an evaluation of the temporal trends in the exploitation level of stocks of UK interest with respect to the fishing mortality target FMSY. The aim is to increase the proportion of stocks fished at or below FMSY and reduce to zero the number of stocks of unknown status relative to FMSY. B) an evaluation of the temporal trends in the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of stocks of UK interest with respect to safe biological limits. The aim is to increase the proportion of stocks with SSB at or above MSY Btrigger and reduce to zero the number of stocks that have unknown status relative to MSY reference points.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=14&Target=14.4","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 14.4","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","computation_definitions":"The indicator comprises two measures assessed separately - A) the percentage of stocks fished at or below the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (FMSY); and B) the percentage of stocks with biomass above the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY Btrigger).","available_disaggregations":"If data do not display, use the dropdown menu (Sustainability level) on the left.

A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. The indicator comprises measures of A) stocks harvested and B) biomass remaining. (A) When the percentage of fish stocks harvested above the level capable of producing MSY decreases, the sustainability of fish stocks can be said to have improved. (B) When the percentage of fish stocks with biomass above levels that maintain full reproductive capacity increases, the sustainability of fish stocks can be said to have improved.
