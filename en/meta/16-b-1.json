Hate crime is also recorded by the police in England and Wales by police force area. The survey provides a better reflection of the extent of household and personal crime than police recorded statistics because the survey includes crimes that are not reported to, or recorded by, the police. The survey is also a better indicator of long-term trends because it is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police or police recording practices.\nThe [Hate crime, England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-2017-to-2018) bulletin publishes hate crime statistics based on both police recorded crime and the crime survey for England and Wales. <br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[16.b.1 Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law (CSV 4.593 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/16-b-1.csv)","indicator":"16.b.1","target_id":"16.b","sdg_goal":"16"}
