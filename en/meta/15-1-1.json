The definition used in the UK calculations only counts areas where the canopy covers more than 20%. Certification in the UK began in 1996, with data collation starting in 2001, becoming a regular annual collation in 2004. New certificates may relate to existing woodland that was not previously certified, or to newly planted areas. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","national_data_update_url_text":"2019-05-23: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/f09b9a7994fddd49acdaa19e63707c8a6cb78e1d","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-06-15: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/18c0caca52d331412bf09473822facfdbd437f45","page_content":"####  **In 2018...**\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The proportion of wooded area in the UK is at the highest point in the last 14 years at 13.1%</strong></li>\n<li>5.67% of woodland area in the UK is certified as sustainably managed</li>\n<li>Scotland has the largest area of woodland as a percentage of total land area in the UK followed by Wales, England then Northern Ireland</li>\n<li>Total woodland area has increased by 5.3% since 2004</li>\n</ul>\n\n#### **Since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 woodland area as a percentage of total land area has increased by 0.1% (UK)**\n\nSee the [Forestry Commission report](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/forestry-statistics/) for more information.\n\nInformation on [Natural Capital](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/uknaturalcapital/landandhabitatecosystemaccounts#ecosystem-accounts-for-woodland/) is available from the Office for National Statistics.<br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[15.1.1 Forest area as a proportion of total land area (CSV 15.161 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/15-1-1.csv)","indicator":"15.1.1","target_id":"15.1","sdg_goal":"15"}
