The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA) - The DAC defines <a href= 'http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm'>ODA</a> as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent). Other Official Flows (OOF) (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. Bilateral Aid -  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes - The DAC Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the <a href= 'http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm'>OECD website</a>.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Official Development Assisstance (ODA) for statistical capacity building","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"ODA","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for International Development (DfID)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2009,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-final-uk-aid-spend-2017","source_url_text_1":"Statistics on International Development 2017","source_release_date_1":"29/11/2018","source_next_release_1":"01/09/2019","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"statistics@dfid.gov.uk","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"17-19-01","other_info":"Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
