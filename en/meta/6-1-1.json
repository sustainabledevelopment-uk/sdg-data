Many countries lack data on one or more elements of safely managed drinking water.  The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) provide national estimates only when data are available on drinking water quality and at least one of the other criteria (accessibility and availability).  Regional and income group estimates are made when data are available for at least 30 percent of the population. Data on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene are produced by the Joint Monitoring Programme of the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) based on administrative sources, national censuses and nationally representative household surveys. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"Please note the data on the chart below is rounded to 3 significant figures.
