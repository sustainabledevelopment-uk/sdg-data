A downward trend in the Red List Index over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward Red List Index trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track. A Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted.<p>The Red List Index reported here is based on global classifications for each species. In other words this Index does not indicate risk of extinction within the UK, but rather, risk of global extinction of species found within the UK.  <p>More detailed information on trends in UK Biodiversity, including information on the National Red List can be found in the <a href=\"https://nbn.org.uk/stateofnature2019/reports/\">State of Nature Report</a>.<p>The Red List Index is based on quantitative objective categories and criteria. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, the Red List Index is calculated from taxonomic groups for which all species have been assessed and reassessed, and, for taxonomic groups that that do not fulfil this criteria, species that are representatively sampled. Changes between categories reflect geniune improvement or deterioration in status, not as a consequence of changes in taxonomy or knowledge. <p>The Red List Index is calculated on an annual basis, however, this does not reflect re-assessment of all species, as species are not assessed every year. The full methodology, and information on limitations can be found in the <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-05-01.pdf\">global metadata</a> and references therin.<p>  Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
