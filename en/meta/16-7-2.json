Table excludes respondents who answered 'don't know' and those with missing answers. 2. Figures for 'Black' and 'Other' ethnic groups for 2014/15 are suppressed because the percentage is based on 5 or fewer responses and is therefore unavailable. 3. Information about respondents' limiting long term illnesses/disabilities are only available for those who completed the online version of the survey. 4. Citizenship - Respondents were instructed to select all that apply so there will be some overlap between citizenship groups. 5. Household income is measured as respondent income combined with the income of cohabiting partner (where applicable) from all sources before deductions. Response categories changed in 2016/17 and the 'no income' category was removed. It's likely that those with no income will have selected 'under \u00a35,199' from 2016/17 onwards. The household income categories are defined in the 'other information' section.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of population agreeing they can influence decisions affecting their local area","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Community","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2013/14","source_geographical_coverage_1":"England","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/community-life-survey--2","source_url_text_1":"Community Life Survey","source_release_date_1":"25/07/2019","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"evidence@culture.gov.uk","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"2013/14","source_geographical_coverage_2":"England","source_url_2":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/dcms-community-life-survey-ad-hoc-statistical-releases","source_url_text_2":"Feeling of being able to influence decisions affecting the local area by citizenship and household income","source_release_date_2":"03/09/2019","source_next_release_2":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official Statistic","source_contact_2":"evidence@culture.gov.uk","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"16-07-02","other_info":"We are reporting on data from 2013/14 as the data collection mode (from face-to-face to online/paper) changed and data would not be comparable with earlier years.
