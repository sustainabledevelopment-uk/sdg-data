The rate for the most recent year is a provisional estimate. 2. The rate of fatal injury for some of the detailed groupings are based on small numbers and are susceptible to considerable year-on-year variation. 3. Detailed breakdowns of fatal injury rates by country/region, age and sex are presented for the last five-years only. 4. Non-fatal injury estimates are based on the Labour Force Survey and are subject to sampling uncertainty. Details, in the form of 95% confidence intervals, can be found in the source data (see 'Sources' tab below). 5. Non-fatal injuries broken down by age, sex, country, English regions, industry sector and occupation are based on averaged rates over a non- overlapping 3 year period to enable a large enough sample size. For example, 2001/02 to 2003/04 figures are displayed at the mid-year point (i.e. 2002/03). 6. Non-fatal injury rates are not provided for sub-groups where  sample numbers are too small to provide reliable estimates. 7. Variations in rate between different sub-groups of age, sex and geography may reflect differences in their employment profile.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Rate of fatal or non-fatal injury in the workplace per 100,000 workers, Great Britain (see data selection criteria for whether the data is displaying fatal or non-fatal injury rates).","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":null,"expected_disaggregations":["Sex","Migrant status"],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Health and Safety Executive (HSE)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":1974,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Great Britain","source_url_1":"http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/tables/index.htm","source_url_text_1":"Fatal injuries in the workplace","source_release_date_1":"30/10/2019","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"Statistics-Request.Team@hse.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"See - RIDHIST - Reported fatal and non-fatal injuries in Great Britain from 1974; RIDREG - RIDDOR reported fatal and non-fatal injuries in Great Britain by country, region and unitary or local authority; RIDAGEGEN - RIDDOR reported fatal and non-fatal injuries in Great Britain by age, gender and broad industry group","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Health and Safety Executive (HSE)","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"2000/01","source_geographical_coverage_2":"Great Britain","source_url_2":"http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/index.htm","source_url_text_2":"Non-fatal injuries in the workplace","source_release_date_2":"30/10/2019","source_statistical_classification_2":"National Statistic","source_contact_2":"Statistics-Request.Team@hse.gov.uk","source_other_info_2":"Data are acquired from the Labour Force Survey.
